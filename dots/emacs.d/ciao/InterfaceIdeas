- On the fly compilation / cheking -- flymake.el?

- Projects

- Shrink and expand method definitions. Button on the left margin to
  do it. 

- Fill in automatically comment headers: look at the closest method
  and take pred name, args, types, etc. from there.

- you can get a list of TODO: comments in the code hitting F6 (they
  appear attached to a tree of the source code)

- Marks automatically in read errors and in yellow areas which are
  condidates for refactoring, with suggestions on what to do ('this
  variable is unused'). Dos it incrementally (do it by running the
  compiler priodically in the background).

- Projects have a 'code style' file which controls tabbing, and other
  style things.

- Can find automatically (almost-)duplicated code. 

- If you change a method or variable name it is changed in every
  place.

- Look at refactoring stuff for Java: safe_delete, etc.
